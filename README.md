# tumblr-vertical
A simple Javascript file that hides the right column, widens images to take up full screen and replaces image url with raw versions. This was made for people with vertical monitors but mostly as a little project for fun.


## How to Install
1. download a Javascript injector plugin
2. paste this code on the injector and set the page it affects to https://www.tumblr.com
3. load your dashboard up on a vertical monitor and admire the large images.
